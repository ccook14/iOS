//Create a 2nd variable with a name of your choosing that has a value of 5
//Create a 3rd variable that stores that sum of the 1st and 2nd variables (20 should print to the screen)
//Create a 4th variable that stores the result of a multiplication operation - the stored result should be equal to 45
//Create a 5th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable minus the 2nd variable - the result should be 10
//Create a 6th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable divided by the 2nd variable - the result should be 3

//Create 3 constants (let) of any name and of any value, but all on the same line

//Create another explicit variable of any name of type Int but DO give it an initial value of 423
